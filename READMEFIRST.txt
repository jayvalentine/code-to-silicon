This is the 'code-to-silicon project'.

CONTENTS:

* REPORT.pdf - This is the final project report.
* REPORT.tex, REFERENCES.bib - These are the source files for the report, from which the PDF is generated using pdflatex.
* figures/ - This directory contains figures used in the report. Where figures are obtained from third-party sources, the sources are cited
  within the report. Figures autogenerated when the tool is run are placed in figures/autogen/.
* UoYCSproject.cls - This is the LaTeX class file used for typesetting the report PDF.
* UOY-Logo-Stacked-shield-Black.png - This is the UoY logo used in the above class file.

* RESULTS.ods - This is a spreadsheet containing the raw results for: performance, power consumption, instructions-per-clock.

* code-to-silicon.py - This is the main command-line utility for running the tool.
* analysis/ parsing/ templates/ toolchain/ translation/ - These directories contain the Python code that makes up the majority of the
  tool's functionality. These files are used by the command-line utility. In addition, two files (templating.py, text.py) are used
  by the tool but are placed in the project root.
* testbench/ - This directory contains files used for testing, including the C source for the benchmark programs themselves.
  Where benchmark software was obtained from third-party sources, the relevant licenses are included in a LICENSE file in the benchmark
  folder.
* link.map - This is a linker script used when compiling programs for the MicroBlaze processor.
* microblaze_system/ - This contains the Vivado project with the MicroBlaze processor and associated peripherals.

RUNNING THE TOOL:

The tool is written for Python 3.5, although it should work with later versions as well, and with minor modifications could be made
to run with earlier versions of Python3. The tool is intended to be platform-independent, but has only been tested on Linux, so no claims
can be made about its portability.

The tool responds to the --help or -h options, which displays a usage text indicating how the tool should be used.
The options are described here in more detail for reference:

--nosim           - Do not run Vivado simulations. Will also avoid running synthesis and power estimation,
	            as this is dependent on the simulation results.
--nosynth         - Do not run Vivado synthesis and power estimation. Simulations will still run.
--notest          - Do not run any tests at all. No figures or results will be generated, and no simulations or synthesis will run.
--noreport        - Do not build the LaTeX report once execution has completed.
--nofig           - Do not generate figures from test results. A results.csv file will still be generated.
--verbosity=level - Logging level. Options are: 0 - debug, 1 - info, 2 - warning, 3 - error.
--selection=mode  - Set selection heuristics used for selecting cores. More than one can be specified. Available options are:
                    hybrid, avgwidth, memdensity, overhead. More detail about these heuristics can be found in the report.
--pruning=mode    - Set aggressiveness of output register pruning. Options are: naive - no pruning, volatile - only prune volatile registers,
                    dependency - perform full register-dependency analysis pruning.
--test=tests      - Set tests to be run. More than one can be specified. Available tests are: sha256, fft.
--help, -h        - display help message.
