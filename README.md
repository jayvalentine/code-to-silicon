# code-to-silicon

This is my final-year project for a BEng Computer Science at the University of York, UK.
It involves the automatic synthesis of hardware acceleration cores generated by parsing the instructions in a program.
The aim is to increase the energy efficiency of a SoC (system-on-chip) by offloading common expressions to hardware accelerators.

For the full report, see [REPORT.pdf].
