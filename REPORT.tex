\title{Hardware Accelerators - Converting Code to Silicon}
\author{Jay Valentine}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This report attempts to show how the efficiency of a system-on-chip implementation can be increased by offloading
the computation of common expressions to hardware accelerator cores, and gives a method for generating VHDL descriptions
of these cores from the original assembly code of a program.
